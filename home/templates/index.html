        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Since early 2000s a small group of friends from college started doing camping trips to hidden jewels of nature in our country. However, over the years, we started noticing that places that used to be lush and green, and water you could see your
            reflection on, were no longer there.</p>
        <p>It was then when we started to see more and more evidences of the so-called climate change, with the most recent examples of Summer in Ireland and a Snowstorm in March.</p>
        <p>Over the past two years, we've started to organize ourselves and expand our experiences, first with our closest friends and family, and more recently within our area of influence.</p>
        <p>Our current aim is to make people aware of their nature surroundings, and appreciate them so the wish to protect it will come naturally (pun intended). We don't care if you "believe" in climate change or not, just treat your nature like if it
            was (which is) your house.</p>

        <h1>What we do</h1>
        <p>We currently have a biweekly walk over parks and trekking routes, especially designed for kids and younger adults, to learn more about the nature that surround us.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer to stay seated, we're also doing some workshops where we teach survival skills, nature appreciation, and other ways of engagement with the community.</p>
        <p>Head over the different sections of the website for more details.</p>
